# Travel and Tour Project

## Overview

The Travel and Tour project is a React-based web application designed to highlight various travel destinations, services, and tour packages. The application features a clean, single-page design with smooth scrolling to different sections, providing a seamless and engaging user experience.

## Features

- **Navbar**: A fixed, responsive navigation bar that allows users to jump to different sections of the page smoothly.
- **Hero Section**: A captivating introductory section with visuals and a welcoming message to grab users' attention.
- **About Section**: Details about the travel agency, its background, and values.
- **Services Section**: A comprehensive overview of the services offered, including travel booking, accommodation, and guided tours.
- **Tours Section**: A collection of tour packages displayed dynamically by mapping over a data array, showcasing various destinations and details.
- **Footer**: Contains additional information, including contact details, social media links, and other relevant information.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building component-based user interfaces.
- **CSS**: Custom styles for layout and visual design, ensuring a cohesive and attractive presentation.
- **JavaScript**: For functionality and dynamic data rendering, particularly for mapping over the tour packages data.

## Navigation

The application implements a single-page layout, with smooth scrolling between sections triggered by anchor links in the navigation bar. Each section is associated with an `id`, allowing for easy navigation via the navbar.

## Data Handling

The Tours section dynamically displays tour packages by mapping over a predefined data array. This approach provides flexibility in displaying multiple items and makes it easy to update or expand the list of tours.
